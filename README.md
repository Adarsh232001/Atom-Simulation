<p>Atom simulation uses only one window. That is
Atom simulation (Main window): This window contains all the contents that is
menu bar and simulation display. This is window used for all the events and
functions in this project. In this window we display simulation of first 10 atoms

<p>Menu bar is designed so that one can easily access the various options like
selecting the elements or starting the simulation or stopping the simulation etc.</p><br/>
<p>As soon as user selects the element and click on the simulate option, the electrons around
the nucleus starts revolving around the nucleus within their orbit.</p></br>
